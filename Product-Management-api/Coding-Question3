Q3:Â What are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API 
to ensure that it is secure and reliable?

ans:
When creating or consuming an API to ensure security and reliability,key considerations 
include: strong authentication methods, robust authorization controls, data encryption, 
rate limiting, API versioning, comprehensive logging and monitoring, clear documentation, 
input validation, proper error handling, and a well-designed API gateway to manage access 
and security policies; all while adhering to best practices for secure coding and data 
handling. 
 
Key security aspects to consider: 
 
Authentication and Authorization:

Authentication: Use methods like OAuth, API keys, or JWTs to confirm user identities.
Authorization: Set permissions to ensure users only access allowed data and actions.
Data Encryption:

Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both during transmission (HTTPS) and while stored.
Rate Limiting:

Limits: Restrict the number of requests a client can make to prevent overloading and attacks.
Input Validation:

Validation: Check and sanitize all input to avoid security risks like data injection.
API Gateway:

Management: Use an API gateway to handle requests, enforce security rules, and manage traffic.
Logging and Monitoring:

Logging: Record API requests and responses to detect issues and monitor for threats.
Monitoring: Keep an eye on API usage for unusual patterns.
Reliability Aspects:

Versioning: Use versioning to maintain compatibility with existing systems during updates.
Documentation: Provide clear instructions on how to use the API, including endpoints and error codes.
Error Handling: Return useful error messages to help with troubleshooting.
Performance: Optimize the API for speed and efficiency.
Resiliency: Ensure the API remains available even if some parts fail.
