1. How will you tackle the challenge above?
To tackle the challenge of processing a CSV file with both plain values and formulas, follow these steps:

Parse the CSV File: Read the input CSV file using a library like Apache Commons CSV. This involves converting the CSV content into a format that can be manipulated programmatically.

Evaluate Formulas: Implement logic to evaluate formulas in the CSV. This could involve parsing and interpreting formulas like =5+A1 or =A2+B2. For each cell that contains a formula:

Identify and replace references (e.g., A1, B2) with their actual values.
Calculate the result and update the cell.
Generate Output CSV: Once all formulas are evaluated, generate a new CSV file with the processed data. Use the same CSV library to write the data to a file.

Handle Errors: Ensure your code handles various edge cases and errors gracefully, such as invalid formulas or missing references.

2. What type of errors would you check for?
When processing CSV files with formulas, check for the following errors:

Invalid Formulas:

Syntax Errors: Ensure formulas are correctly formatted and syntactically valid.
Unrecognized Functions: Handle cases where the formula uses functions or syntax not supported by your implementation.
Missing References:

Undefined Variables: Check if formula references (e.g., A1, B2) exist in the CSV. Handle cases where references are missing or out of bounds.
Data Type Mismatches:

Non-numeric Values: Ensure that operations involving numeric calculations handle non-numeric values appropriately.
Parsing Errors:

Incorrect CSV Formatting: Handle cases where the CSV file is not well-formed or contains unexpected delimiters or line breaks.
File Handling Errors:

Empty or Corrupted Files: Ensure the file is not empty and can be read successfully.
3. How might a user break your code?
Here are some ways a user might break your code:

Malformed CSV File:

Improper Formatting: Uploading a CSV file with incorrect formatting, such as missing commas or inconsistent row lengths, might cause parsing issues.
Complex Formulas:

Unsupported Operations: Using formulas with complex functions or syntax that your implementation doesn’t support can lead to errors or incorrect results.
Missing References:

Undefined Cells: If a formula references cells that don’t exist or are empty, it could result in calculation errors or exceptions.
Large Files:

Performance Issues: Very large CSV files might cause performance problems or memory issues if not handled efficiently.
Non-Numeric Values in Numeric Operations:

Invalid Data: Including non-numeric values where numeric operations are expected can lead to errors or crashes.
